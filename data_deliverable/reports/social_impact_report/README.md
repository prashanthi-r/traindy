# Socio-historical Context and Impact Report

## Socio-historical Context

### Who are the major stakeholders?
I think the major stakeholders are H&M and the Users

### Societal factors affecting our data and prediction
Some factors that might be affecting our data and prediction could be age or gender because more data might be present from section of society than others across the dataset

#### What should we do?
We can try balancing the dataset to reduce bias towards certain classes or products in the recommendation task

### Relevant work
NASDAQ Recommendation system by Pai, S.


## Ethical Considerations

### Biases in data collection
Based on histograms, ages 18-23 and ages 50-55 show the biggest peaks in dataset, which clearly displays an age bias. We expect to see more biases of this kind based on the population of Users. Further, data can be skewed because of gift giving where the user is not representative of the people actually consuming the products


### Biases in data interpretation
1. The recommendation system may be more likely to suggest certain products to certain customers based on their age group/location (postal code) more than the others. This may be a systemic bias in the interpretation of collected data. For instance, recommending branded and expensive items only to higher income neighborhoods (postal code) or certain categories of clothing to targeted age groups. 


### Privacy issues and solutions
It is important to consider what data can be used by our model because the recommendations can reveal information about the users that they might otherwise want to keep private. For instance, suggesting maternity clothes to users based on past purchases or customer preferences can be considered an invasion of privacy.


### Misuses of our project results
1) The project can be used by competitors of H&M to derive recommendations and use that to upsell products, this affects one of the stakeholders
2) Selling customer preferences and consumption patterns to third parties and typecasting people based on these factors
